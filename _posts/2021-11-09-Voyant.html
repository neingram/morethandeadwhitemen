<p>To create the following visualizations, I used <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant,</a> a "web-based text reading and analysis environment," created by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/grockwel">Geoffrey Rockwell</a> and the late <a href="https://csdh-schn.org/stefan-sinclair-in-memoriam/">St√©fan Sinclair,</a> using the <a href=https://neingram.github.io/morethandeadwhitemen/2021/10/09/Dataset.html>dataset</a> I developed for this project.</p>

<p>I chose to use Voyant's tag-cloud feature, <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/cirrus">Cirrus,</a> which uses size to represent the frequency of each specific term.</p>

<p>Looking at the visualization above of the authors' names, you can clearly see that the most prominent name dispalyed is "William Shakespare." Two other names visually jump out, "James" and "John." Thus, despite the push for greater <a href="https://neingram.github.io/morethandeadwhitemen/2021/10/18/WhoseStory.html">curriculum diversity</a> as connected to the call for <a href="https://neingram.github.io/morethandeadwhitemen/2021/10/18/The-Rise-of-Multiculturalism.html">"multiculturalism"</a> in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1990s, it's striking to note the continued prominence of both William Shakespeare as a central author in high school ELA curricula, as well as the dominance of typical Anglo male names, "James" and "John."

<p>Visualizing the titles of the assigned texts provides insight into the link between public educaiton and the formation of citizens in the United States.</p>

<p>The Founders of the United States were explicit about the connection they saw between public educaiton and the democratic project. For example, James Madison in an 1822 letter said</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote>A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, in "A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge" argued for the education "at the expence of all" as a safeguard against tyranny." 
            
<p>The top three words in the visualization above, "America," "address," and "dream," speak to the enduring legacy of this connection between public education and civic education, highlighting underlying ideological themes in contemporary public school ELA education. Given this connection between citizenship and the stories studied in the context of high school ELA classrooms, questions such as, "Whose stories are told?", "Who is included in the curriculum?", "To what extent?" have implications beyond the walls of the classroom. The answers to these questions illustrate questions of national belonging-- who does or does not count as a citizen?
