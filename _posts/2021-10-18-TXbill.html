<p>Far from being moves of political posturing, contemporary pieces of legislation focused on Critical Race Theory substantially impact the content of school curricula. For example, an early October 2021 professional development session for teachers in the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, Texas intended to advise teachers how to meet requirements outlined by <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/HB03979I.pdf">Texas House Bill 3979,</a> passed on June 15, 2021. In audio taken during the session and subsequently obtained by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/southlake-texas-holocaust-books-schools-rcna2965">NBC News,</a> a top administer can be heard telling teachers that if they have a book in their library related to the Holocaust, they must ensure they have another book to offer students an “opposing” perspective. Following the training, on October 7, 2021, Carroll administrators sent teachers an email “directing them to close their classroom libraries ‘until they can be vetted by the teacher.’” An additional email circulated a “Classroom Library Selection Rubric,” containing criteria for “Credibility (HB3979),” “Perspective (HB3979), and “Appropriateness (no explicit violence, language or sexual situations).” The rubric assigns a “Standard Not Met (0 points)” to books that “represent a singular, dominant narrative in such a way that it cannot be balanced with other materials/may be considered offensive.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/HB03979I.pdf">language of the legislation itself </a>states that “No teacher, administrator, or other employee in any state agency, school district, campus, open-enrollment charter school, or school administration shall require, or make part of a course the following concepts: … (2) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;… 6) an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex; (7) any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; or (8) meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a member of a particular race to oppress members of another race.</p>

<p>When combined with the more explicit teacher training session and “Classroom Library Selection Rubric,” the intentions of the legislators become clear—to outlaw, as fully as possible, any discussion of race in public schools, particularly any discussion that would prompt students to grapple with the complex history and ongoing presence of racism in America.</p>
