<p>The types of texts students are exposed to shape their perception of their history and future, individual and collective. As agents of the state, schools present a vision of the world to their students and participate in the discursive construction of what it means to be an American. The representations in curricula have a profound effect on students’ perception of the world around them and their understanding of the history of the United States.</p>

<p>Increased diversity in text selection is one way that curricula can represent the plurality of America, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that students need not engage with some of the classic texts. Two prominent scholars, <a href="https://bc.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/1046073742">Edward Said</a> in postcolonial theory and Eve Sedgwick in the field of queer theory, wrote influential texts that upended the state of scholarship at the time of their publication using canonical works. Said examined authors such as Jane Austen and Joseph Conrad; Sedgwick’s <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520254060/epistemology-of-the-closet-updated-with-a-new-preface"> Epistemology of the Closet</a> reads works by Henry James and Herman Melville. What these critics do differently from what most public school students will do with similar texts is engage in a “reading against the grain,” purposefully reading against a text's dominant reading. Schoolchildren are capable of such a reading, but it must be given attention and paired with explicit instruction on methodology, which would necessitate the types of conversations about dynamics like race, empire, gender, and sexuality that conservative legislators aim to make illegal in classrooms across the nation. </p>
