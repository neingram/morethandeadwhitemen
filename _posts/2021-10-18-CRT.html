<p>Described by Trump’s White House as “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-white-house-says-critical-race-theory-anti-american-ncna1239825">"anti-American,"</a>Critical Race Theory, a framework initially developed by Kimberlé Crenshaw and outlined in a 1991 volume of the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Stanford Law Review,</a>, builds on a long history of American American Feminist scholarship, including the <a href="https://americanstudies.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Keyword%20Coalition_Readings.pdf">1977 Combahee River Collective Statement</a>and <a href="https://thehermitage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Sojourner-Truth_Aint-I-a-Woman_1851.pdf">Sojourner Truth's 1951 address</a>at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio.</p>

<p>Emboldened by President Trump’s call for “patriotic education,” lawmakers across the country have been introducing legislation that outright bans teaching Critical Race Theory, severely limits what teachers can discuss in their classrooms, or a combination of the two. Sarah Schwartz, reporting for Education Week, has been tracking the legislative moves across the nation as related to restrictions connected to Critical Race Theory, noting:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">“As of August 26, 27 states have introduced bills or taken other steps that would restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism, according to an Education Week analysis. Twelve states have enacted these bans, either through legislation or other avenues.”</blockquote>
