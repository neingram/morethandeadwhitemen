<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-19250-2_7">“The Literary canon and the classic text,”</a> Ann Thompson defines “the canon” in the following way:  </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The literary canon can be narrowly defined as that which is accepted as authentic (for example, in the context of distinguishing canonical from apocryphal works in relation to the Bible or Shakespeare). Still, it is usually defined more broadly as that which is assumed to be ‘good’ or the ‘best’ literature: those texts worth preserving and passing on from one generation to the next.</blockquote>

<p>This notion of “the canon” is deeply knitted to ideas about education and national identity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00220272.2010.524715">“On literature’s use(ful/less)ness: reconceptualizing the literature curriculum in the age of globalization,”</a> Suzanne S. Choo sketches a brief history of the political and ideological underpinnings of English Literary education in public schools.</p>

<p>Choo notes that the late 19th-century marked a shift in the approach to literary instruction in schools, where instruction moved away from a religious focus and towards a form of “’ fiction making’ designed to develop a sense of nationhood through recreation and retelling of its mythological histories in story form.”</p>

<p>Rather than a concrete, discrete category, “the canon” has always represented a highly-contested, fluid space intimately connected to larger political and ideological cultural contexts. </p>
