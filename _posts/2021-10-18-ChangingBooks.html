<p>Proposed curricular changes often meet with backlash; a notable example is the so-called<a href="https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2010/septemberoctober/statement/battle-over-books">"Textbook Wars"</a>of Kanawha County. What started as a motion by the board of education for Kanawha County, Western Virginia in the spring of 1974 to begin the process of purchasing new textbooks quickly escalated into bombings, a Ku Klux Klan march on the capital, and gun violence against protesters.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Accounts for So Much Rage?</h2>

<p>On the surface, the reaction in Kanawha County makes little sense, but when examined through the perspective of the public school as a nexus for the creation and maintenance of various myths about self and nation, it begins to make more sense.</p>

<p>Schools, with their population of real, flesh-and-blood children, nevertheless evoke the archetypical Child that Lee Edelman asserts is foundational to his theory of “reproductive futurism” outlined in <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/no-future"> No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive.</a>Reproductive futurism, names the oft-cited motivation of “fighting for the children,” linking politics itself to a fantasy of the future embodied in the archetypical figure of the Child. Edelman takes care to highlight the common link between reproductive futurism rhetoric and American conservative concerns, such as the family, abortion, and gay marriage.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">“That figural Child alone embodies the citizen as an ideal, entitled to claim full rights to its future share in the nation’s good, though always at the cost of limiting the rights “real” citizens are allowed. For the social order exists to preserve for this universalized subject this fantastic Child, a notional freedom more highly valued than the actuality of freedom itself, which might after all, put at risk the Child to whom such a freedom falls due” (11).</blockquote>

<p>This logic of reproductive futurism, activated by the population of children in public schools, collides with what Richard T. Hughes in <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctv65sz08>Myths America Lives By: White Supremacy and the Stories That Give Us Meaning</a> deems “the primal American myth that informs all others”—the “Myth of White Supremacy.” Detailing the way that the Myth of White Supremacy is embedded at every level in our culture and society, Hughes also explores the ways that this particular myth interacts with other national myths to obscure the different realities facing Black and White Americans and the strength of attachment White Americans have to this myth in particular.</p>
