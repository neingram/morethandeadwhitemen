<p>Legislators attempting to ban discussions Critical Race Theory or other “controversial” topics in the classroom have identified and are attempting to weaponize through the legal and educational institutions the power of language to construct one’s worldview. Scholars across disciplines have long been interested in the relationship between language, perception, and power, specifically the potential for language to shape or change ideology. In contrast to conservative legislators, Judith Butler points to the power of language to foster understandings across difference. Drawing from a Foucauldian framework, <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Judith+Butler+Reader-p-9780631225942">Judith Butler</a> cautions against “taking for granted one’s own linguistic horizon as the ultimate linguistic horizon.” It is only through “undergoing the discomfort and the anxiety of realizing that the scheme of intelligibility on which we rely fundamentally is not adequate, is not common, and closes us off from the possibility of understanding others and ourselves in a more fundamentally capacious way.”</p>

<p>Gloria Anzalduá in <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Borderlands/fmuvtAEACAAJ?hl=en">Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza</a> pays particular attention to the power of language to shape identity, shore up hegemonic power structures, and subvert those same structures. Drawing from her experience growing up in the borderlands between Mexico and Texas, Anzalduá says:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">"For a people who are neither Spanish nor live in a country in which Spanish is the first language; for a people who live in a country in which English is the reigning tongue but who are not Anglo; for a people who cannot entirely identify with either standard (formal, Castillian) Spanish nor standard English, what recourse is left to them but to create their own language? A language which they can connect their identity to, one capable of communicating the realities and values true to themselves-- a language with terms that are neither español ni inglés, bot both. We speak a patois, a forked tongue, a variation of two languages" (55).</blockquote>
