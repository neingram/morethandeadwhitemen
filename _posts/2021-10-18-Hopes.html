<p>The genesis for this project is deeply personal. During the seven years I taught in secondary classrooms, I never once had to follow a department or district-mandated curricula, nor did I teach out of a textbook. This particular pedagogical situation was primarily a result of working in under-resourced schools—I simply never had the institutional financial support to obtain such classroom materials. However, after a few years of implementing reader’s workshop with my students, instrumentalizing my relationship with each individual student to “match” them with books I hoped would turn them into lifelong readers, I no longer felt envious of teachers with whom I received my certification whose instructional minutes were carefully, stringently divided according to standardized scope and sequence guides and curricular frameworks implemented by policy decisions made largely by non-educators.</p>

<p>I knew my situation was unique, and I wondered, how diverse are district-approved curricular materials in the solidly blue states of California (where I’m from and taught) and New York? Presumably, I thought, the political climate of these populous, blue states would mean that their curricula might represent some of the most progressive in the nation and any gaps in their adopted instructional materials in terms of diversity and inclusion would reflect the best possible curricular situation for American public school students.</p>

<p>Selection of texts is a profoundly political act—one that is intimately connected to how students see themselves and their place in the world and understand their pasts and imagine their futures.</p>

<p>I hope this project provides multiple parties in the education world—teachers, curriculum specialists, school leaders, policymakers, and students themselves—insight into the current state of representation in district-approved English Language Arts curriculum, illuminating hidden narratives these current canons reveal about whose stories are valued and highlighting space for continued growth.</p>
