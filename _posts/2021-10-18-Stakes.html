<p>In <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/43632/11162_2005_Article_2967.pdf?sequence=1">“Curriculum Matters; Creating a Positive Climate for Diversity from the Student Perspective,”</a> Matthew J. Mayhew, Heidi E. Grunwald, and Eric L. Dey explore the components that contribute to a positive campus climate for diversity, outlining four crucial factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Campus’ historical legacy of inclusion or exclusion of various racial or ethnical groups.”</li>
  <li>“Structural diversity (i.e., the numerical and proportional representation of diverse groups on campus)</li>
  <li>“Psychological climate (i.e., perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about diversity)</li>
  <li>“Behavioral climate (i.e., how different racial and ethnic groups interact on campus."</li>
</ul>


<p>Mayhew et al. emphasize the importance of campus climate in students’ success, saying that of those students who choose to remain, “they are unlikely to be successful” (113).</p>

<p>In addition to academic success, feelings of inclusion and belonging in school are connected to health outcomes among marginalized students. Marginalized groups have a well-documented record of poorer health outcomes compared to non-marginalized groups, which is related to the ongoing stigma and discrimination that members of marginalized groups face. For example, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/stigma-and-discrimination.htm">the CDC</a> notes that a 2009 study compared the effects of family support on LGBTQ+ youth, finding that youth who experienced stronger familial rejection were approximately:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8 times more likely to have tried to commit suicide</li>
  <li>6 times more likely to report high levels of depression</li>
  <li>3 times more likely to use illegal drugs</li>
  <li>3 times more likely to engage in risky sex</li>
</ul>

<p>The school environment is also vital to positive outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">“A positive school environment is associated with less depression, fewer suicidal feelings, lower substance use, and fewer unexcused school absences among LGBT students.”</blockquote>

<p>School climate related to diversity also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532404/">affects health outcomes for non-white students.</a> The profoundly damaging effects of racism have been long documented. Still, the research also demonstrates the harmful effects of the more subtle forms of racism, such as deeply embedded structural and institutional racism.</p>

<p>Thus, while an English Language Arts curriculum that disproportionately includes white authors might not appear as racist on the surface, the structure of such curriculum subtly communicates to students from marginalized backgrounds that their stories and voices are not important enough—or that that they simply do not exist. If we think about the cumulative effect such repetitive messaging can have—over a span of twelve years of compulsory education—we might begin to ask questions about the correlation between the extent to which students are exposed to curricula that reflect the diversity of their communities and the world and measures of academic success and health among marginalized groups.</p>
