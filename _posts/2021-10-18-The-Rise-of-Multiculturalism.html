<p>In the <a href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/textbooks/">1960s and 1970s</a>civil rights advocates called for school desegregation and increased diversity in curricular materials. This call for “multiculturism” aimed to present American schoolchildren with perspectives other than that of the dominant one present in their school books, that of “Dick and Jane” and “stories about a white, middle-class family in an all-white community.”</p>

<p>This notion of “the canon” is deeply knitted to ideas about education and national identity.</p>

<p>Writing in the early 1990s, Toni Morrison examined the relationship between whiteness, cultural definitions of American selfhood, and literature at length in <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674673779">Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination.</a></p>

<p>Moving beyond arguments for increased diversity, Morrison urged for a more complete examination of the way that America’s history of chattel slavery not only shaped the experience of slaves but indelibly affected “the mind, imagination, and behavior of masters.” In this way, Morrison underscored the importance of thinking critically about the canon, particularly to make visible ideological underpinnings of the collections of text that are used to shape the next generation of writers and thinkers.</p>
