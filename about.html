<em>More Than Old Dead White Men?</em> is a digital humanities project created as part of Boston College’s Fall 2021 Graduate Colloquium in the Digital Humanities with instructor Stephen Sturgeon. 

<em>More Than Old Dead White Men?</em> examines the contents of approved instructional materials for core English Language Arts courses, grades 9-12 within the two largest school districts in the nation—the New York City Department of Education and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The New York City Department of Education <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/reports/doe-data-at-a-glance">serves</a> 1,094,138 students, and LAUSD <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/ceflargesmalldist.asp"> serves approximately</a> 596, 937 students. Both California and New York permit instructional material adoption at the local level. Still, the curriculum decisions made within each state often impact the educational landscape nationally because of the number the districts collectively serve.

<p>The <a href="https://neingram.github.io/morethandeadwhitemen/2021/10/09/Dataset.html">dataset</a> that I created for this project documents features of each text included in curricular materials, including author’s gender, date of publication, national origin of author, author’s ethnicity, and text genre.</p>

<p>The canon that high school students are exposed to influences their understanding of the texts that they read and offers a particular view of the world. To what vision of the world are high school students in LAUSD and NYC being exposed? How does the world present in their English curricula texts align with or depart from that of the world outside the walls of the classroom?</p>

<p>Textbook adoptions and curricular decisions have long been politicized in the United States. Contemporary discussions have given increased attention to the value of diversity and inclusion in the instructional materials to which students are exposed. I hope that this project serves as a way for educational leaders to better understand the texts to which public school students are exposed and a resource for future curricular decision-making.</p>
